## What is this article about
How easy is to host a static website now!

## Why am I writing on this
If you don't know yet about easy hosting on GitHub Pages, you should.

# What is GitHub Pages
"*GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.*"

I tried to host few of my Web Applications via container on Kubernetes, and it's not a trivial task. So GitHub Pages magically do this for you for your static website and abstract all details away.

## How to setup your website on GitHub
It's as easy as creating a new repository in your GitHub account. Just make sure repository name is ***{username}.github.io***

That's all.
