## What is this article about
Few reasons which motivated me to go for static website, which does NOT depend on any framework, implementation library, setting up deployment steps, server side rendering (ssr).

## Why am I writing on this
For pure learning purpose. 

I have been to many Web projects which developed by using some framework. But I never developed any website purely in html/css/javascript. And when I tried, it's painful. I have lost touch. 

Framework and libraries like angular/reactjs/aspnet MVC makes you very productive but it abstracts you from building blocks. Nothing against them, fact is, you can't live without them in today's web worlds. But I want to learn basics.

*Hope I'm not the only one having this feeling.*

## Terminologies
#### Static Website
We would have plain HTML, plain CSS and plain javascript. 
There would only be GET calls. We are not saving anything back. Though we will use third-party *non-magical* utility javascript libraries.
#### WebApplication
These are served by WebServer after extra logic been executed. Shopping Website: which need to save your cart and payment logic, or banking website, social network sites etc. Magic happens on server side code. It's awesome, but complicated.

## Benefits of Static Website over WebApplication 
I am not satisfy with my current knowledge in css/ html/ javascript and I am hoping to gain my knowledge back.

I want to start writing my blog, and don't want to worry about managing code for blog admin, data. I am going to externalize this to GitHub.

I don't want to be worry about managing and paying for my hosting. I am going to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Plan for future
I am planning to write on technical topics of web development, aspnetcore, openIdConnect, cloud native development, performance.

As I am planning to learn more and more on javascript, I would like to migrate to some cool javascript framework or library like reactjs, but that would happen once I know the logic behind the magic.
