## What is this article about
To learn [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), a application state management library, **without** ReactJs.

## Why am I writing on this
One of my near term goal is to learn ReactJs, and I think learning on Redux is also needed to work with ReactJs. Though Redux itself doesn't depend on ReactJs. So trying Redux in isolation with plain javascript.

## Let's start using Redux for this website

### Download
As I am NOT yet using npm for this website, I downloaded it from [CDN](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/redux/4.0.4/redux.min.js) and add this to /lib/js folder. (Why this is 7kb when advertised as 2kb library? We will see?).


### Version used
4.0.4

### 5 Concepts or Redux
1. Action  
2. Action Creator  
3. Reducer  
4. Store  
5. Strict Unidirectional Dataflow

### 3 Principles of Redux
1. Single Source of truth  
2. State is ReadOnly  
3. Changes are made with [Pure function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function)  


# I am taking a pause on this one, as this website has not any State to manage yet, but I have plans. We will come back to this.
