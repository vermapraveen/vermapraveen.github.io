## What is this article about
Idea would be to start with a simple static website, which doesn't depend on server side rendering (ssr). 
I will try to use html, css, and lots of vanilla javascript.

## Why are you writing about this
I am not satisfy with my current knowledge in css/ html/ javascript. 
I have lost touch to basic building blocks of web development. 
Reason for above 2 points are, uses of aspnetMVC or angular/ reactjs library in many of my Web Application projects, which abstracted me from many concepts. 

I am trying to take control back.

## How to start
